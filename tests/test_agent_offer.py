"""Bounded inline tool offer for an explicit-offer (agent/scheduled) turn.

Motivated by a measured incident (2026-07-19, live agents.json): the "Transaction &
Trade Logger" agent's 143-tool ``allowed_tools`` resolved to 135 live schemas —
156K+ chars sent inline on EVERY model round trip of every scheduled fire, 4x the
entire interactive CORE offer. This module (``ai/tools/_agent_offer``) bounds a
LARGE explicit offer to a small inline slice + ``find_tools`` + the discovery gate,
while a SMALL offer (an agent's whole point — a short, curated tool list) stays
fully inline, byte-identical to before this module existed.

The load-bearing property under test: **reach never shrinks**. Every tool in a
large agent's ``allowed_tools`` must still be callable within the SAME turn (via
the same auto-load-then-validate lazy path interactive chat's discovery gate uses)
— this changes DELIVERY (inline now vs. discovered lazily), never the turn's
reachable universe (ADR ``2026-07-18-remove-layered-ai-permission-system``:
``allowed_tools`` is configuration, not an enforced ceiling).

Offline + isolated: no LLM, no network. ContextVars are reset between tests.
