"""Significance screen — the volume-independent fast path for material news
(news-ingestion-latency.md §4, Phase 2).

A ``core.news_arrivals`` CONSUMER (registered at boot in main.py): on every arrival batch, it
filters to rows whose subjects match a ``monitor_news`` watched entity, clusters same-subject
headlines by normalized-title token overlap (cheap, no LLM), and for each not-recently-screened
cluster runs ONE BATCHED LLM significance call (headline+source only, fenced as untrusted,
task ``news_screen``) returning per-cluster ``material: bool`` + a one-line reason. A cluster
ruled material enqueues a ``PendingAnalysisStore`` row (``trigger="material_news"``) — the
existing analyst sweep (already draining every ~60s) picks it up and pushes to the news route (services.notify_routes)
exactly like a news_spike, but WITHOUT needing volume: ONE Bloomberg headline is enough.

Caps: per-tick cluster cap (``_MAX_CLUSTERS_PER_TICK``), a rolling calendar-day screen budget
(own counter, mirrors analyst.py's ``_DAILY_ANALYSIS_CAP`` pattern — state in
``CACHE_DIR/news_screen_state.json``, digest.py's state-marker convention), and a 6h dedup
window that is CLUSTER-AWARE, not subject-blanket (INT12, fixed after a live incident: the old
blanket per-subject cooldown suppressed the Prosus-stake and Uber-bid follow-ups on the SAME
subject as an already-screened formal-offer headline, even though each was a materially new fact,
not a re-syndication). A candidate cluster's own token fingerprint (``cluster_tokens``, persisted
on the enqueued row's payload) is compared against every material_news row enqueued for that
subject within the window (``PendingAnalysisStore.recent_material_events``) using the SAME overlap
threshold ``_cluster_rows`` clusters with (``_CLUSTER_OVERLAP``) — a fuzzy match suppresses the
re-syndicated copy, a miss lets the genuinely new cluster through. A subject-level floor
(``_SUBJECT_SCREEN_FLOOR``) caps how many DISTINCT clusters may screen per subject per window
before falling back to a blanket cooldown, so cluster-splitting can't be used to spam unlimited
alerts for one subject. NO-OPs cleanly (log + return) whenever the LLM seam is unavailable or
nothing qualifies — this must never crash the poll tick that triggered it (core.news_arrivals.emit
also isolates it, but this module guards itself too so a bug here is diagnosable from ITS OWN log
line).

Per-subject coalescing (INT14b, `db/pending_analysis_store.py`): every enqueue above now routes
through `PendingAnalysisStore.upsert_pending`, which MERGES into an already-pending row for the
same subject instead of always appending a new one — a hot subject's redundant news_spike/crash/
material_news triggers accumulate onto ONE analysis instead of each spawning its own. This module's
own INT12 anti-cluster-splitting-spam floor still works correctly under that coalescing because it
counts DISTINCT screen EVENTS (`recent_material_events`), not pending ROWS.
