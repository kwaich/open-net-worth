"""``core.unattended`` must stay ONE fact with ONE reader.

Its predecessor (``ai.tools._skill_scope.is_unattended``) started as this exact fact and
grew a second job: a tool-AUTHORIZATION ceiling checked on every dispatch. Because an
Automation's granted-tool list is empty until the owner approves something, that ceiling
refused every tool on every run — a scheduled job fetched mail, was refused on everything
after, and reported the refusals as a "configuration issue" (live, 2026-08-10).

Deleting the flag fixed the ceiling and silently killed the fact too, which ``run_script``'s
unsupervised-execution gate depends on. So it is back, deliberately narrow. These tests are
the narrowness.
