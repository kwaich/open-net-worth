"""
xray_service — ETF look-through ("X-ray") portfolio exposure (P2-INV5).

A book that looks diversified by ticker can be concentrated once you look THROUGH the
ETFs. Each instrument may carry a `constituents` map (its exposure breakdown:
[{weight, sector, region, label}]) supplied by the user / Lucius. This service explodes
each held position's BASE value across its declared constituents and aggregates
portfolio-wide by sector and by region, with an honest "unmapped %".

Semantics:
  - A plain stock/coin (constituents == []) contributes 100% of its value to ITS OWN
    `sector` (and region "" → counted as unmapped on the region axis). It is NOT opaque —
    it is its own exposure.
  - An ETF with constituents spreads its value by weight. Any weight shortfall (Σ < 1)
    is counted as `unmapped` (the part of the fund we can't see through).
  - All value math is in BASE currency, valued the SAME way the rest of the app does
    (qty × price × quote_per_unit, FX-converted) by consuming hydrated rows. No
    revaluation here — we reuse positions_service.hydrated() + core.fx.to_base.

This is DISTINCT from RiskPanel's "sector by holding" (which groups whole positions by the
instrument's single sector); X-ray spreads an ETF across many sectors. Read-only insight.

Imports downward only (db + core) — no api/ai (Contract). Math lives HERE, never the
router/tool/UI.
