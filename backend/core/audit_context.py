"""Per-run AUDIT scope — the transaction-provenance seam.

Every transaction mutation (create/update/delete/restore) funnels through the ledger
write choke points in ``services/ledger.py``. To record *who* changed a row, *through
what surface*, *driven by what request*, and link it back to the originating chat —
the ledger needs context that only the UPPER layers possess (the chat session id, the
acting connector, the user's message, the HTTP route). Threading that as parameters
would mean a wide signature change across ``create_transaction`` / ``bulk_*`` /
``update_transaction`` and every caller and test.

So this is a ContextVar seam, a direct clone of ``core.email_consumer``: the upper
layer (``ai.assistant`` for chat, ``connectors.chat.run`` for messaging channels,
``api.ledger`` for the UI/REST, ``ai.automation_runner_adapter`` for Automation runs, ``mcp.adapter``
for MCP, ``services.scheduling`` for recurring posts, ``services.import_common`` for
imports) SETS the scope before its write and CLEARS it in a ``finally``; the ledger
choke point READS it at persist time and stamps the audit event.

It lives in ``core`` (a leaf — stdlib only) for the SAME reason ``core.email_consumer``
and ``core.auto_apply_scope`` do: it is a seam shared across a layer boundary. The
setters are called from ``api``/``ai`` WITHOUT those modules being imported by
``services``/``db`` (import-linter Contracts 1 & 3); the ledger (``services``) only READS.

Propagation mirrors ``core.email_consumer``: the upper layer ``await``s straight down
into the write (no fresh ``contextvars.Context`` on the path), so a scope set above is
visible at the ledger. The default is ``None`` — a path that never sets a scope (a test,
a one-off script, an un-instrumented entrypoint) resolves to ``None`` and the ledger
records a minimal fallback event (actor "system", surface "unknown"). No write is ever
blocked by a missing scope.

      rather than acting directly: the Automation TITLE behind the run ("Weekly Fraud
      Checking") or posted a recurring template — a snapshot for display. The actor is WHO did

    - ``automation_id`` — the stable scheduled-task id behind ``automation`` (the durable,

      to show. Mirrors how an Automation is captured as ``automation_id`` + ``automation``.

      triggers use it with ``automation_id`` to prevent a run from feeding its own writes
