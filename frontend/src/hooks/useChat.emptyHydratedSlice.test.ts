// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// An Automation's conversation rendered the empty-state greeting forever, while the run card
// beside it showed a completed run with a full task list. The server had the transcript the
// whole time — 38 entries, a 10k-char opening message and an assistant turn carrying 20 tool
// blocks (owner, 2026-08-16).
//
// The slice was sealed empty. `useChat`'s hydration effect skipped on `slice.hydrated` alone,
// and the apply inside it deferred to `s.hydrated` alone. So opening the conversation ONCE
// while it was still empty — mid-run, or before the server had written anything — stamped
// `{messages: [], hydrated: true}` permanently. The effect never re-ran for that conversation,
// and `reconcileWithRemote` could not rescue it either: `shouldAdoptRemote` returns false on
// an empty remote, so the one check that might have refilled it declined too.
//
// A LIVE run looked fine throughout, because the live-attach path populates the slice without
// going through hydration at all. That is why the bug read as random rather than as a rule.
//
// Hydrated-AND-EMPTY is the absence of a result, not a result. The guard exists to stop a
// stale cache read clobbering a POPULATED slice; an empty one has nothing to protect.
