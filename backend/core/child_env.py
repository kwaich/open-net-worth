"""The environment handed to a process this app starts on someone's behalf.

An ALLOWLIST, not a blocklist: a child inherits only what a command line tool needs to find its
programs, its home and the network, and anything else — this app's own settings and logins,
provider keys, cloud credentials, whatever the operator exported — is absent unless the caller
adds it explicitly (``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` only when one is stored for that provider). One filter
serves the Claude Code / Codex providers and the terminal, so none of them can drift.
Stdlib only — ``core`` is a leaf.
