"""Free-text spend search bucketed into weeks — the `lux-coffee` widget's shape.

The widget fetched matching transactions and summed them into Monday-start weeks in the
browser. The search itself was already a server filter (ledger's cross-store payee/category
join); only the weekly fold was client-side. It runs here now, so the bars and the "avg
$X/wk" figure come from the same place as every other Overview number.
