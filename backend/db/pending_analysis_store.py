"""PendingAnalysisStore — durable ledger of crash/news events awaiting LLM analysis.

Each row records one enqueued event awaiting analysis. The ~60s analysis sweep claims rows
atomically, runs the LLM synthesis, updates the Intel signal, and marks done. Failed rows are
retried up to 3 times, then permanently failed.

Per-subject coalescing (INT14b): `upsert_pending` is the enqueue choke every producer (crash
watch, the fast/slow news-spike pollers, the material-news significance screen) now routes
through — it MERGES a trigger into an existing UNCLAIMED `pending` row for the same subject
instead of always appending a new one, so a hot subject's many triggers analyze together instead
of spawning a redundant row (and a redundant LLM synthesis) per trigger. See `upsert_pending`'s
own docstring for the merge rules and `recent_material_events` for how the INT12 significance-
screen cooldown keeps counting distinct screen events correctly under coalescing.

PLAN 4C TASK 1: DB-backed (Tier-2 logs, table ``pending_analysis``) via ``PayloadTableStore``.
Checkpoint-EXCLUDED (``ai/checkpoint._EXCLUDED_TABLES``) — runtime scheduler state (drain/fill
cycle), never snapshotted. ``claim``/``mark_failed`` are the CAS-gated primitives (Design Note
3, plan 4c); `upsert_pending`'s merge-by-subject scan is a direct read-modify-write inside one
transaction. The old ``fail_closed_on_corrupt=False`` opt-out has no DB-era equivalent —
dropped, not ported.

        spawn one row per trigger, e.g. 230 news_spike + 107 material_news rows for one Uber/KSTL
        story, each re-reading the same handful of headlines and producing a near-identical
        analysis). A `claimed`/`done` row is left ALONE — coalescing only targets a still-open
        `pending` row, so once a subject's analysis is in-flight or complete, the next trigger
        opens a fresh row (the subject is "hot again", not stale news for an already-drafted
        analysis).

          * `created_at` stays the EARLIEST arrival — `analyst._row_age_hours`'s staleness guard
            (INT14a) measures how long the subject has been waiting for an analysis, not how
            recently it was last pinged.
          * `triggers` accumulates every distinct trigger kind that has contributed so far
            (informational — lets a caller/test see the full history at a glance).
          * `trigger`/payload go "material_news"-STICKY: once ANY merge carries a material_news
            trigger — the only kind that carries an actual headline, never a bare price/volume
            ping — the row's `trigger` becomes (and stays) "material_news", so analyst.py's
            existing `>>> NEW` marker check (``row["trigger"] == "material_news"``) and event
            framing keep working UNMODIFIED. A later material_news merge overwrites the marker
            fields (headline/published_at/first_seen/cluster_tokens/reason) with its OWN — "the
            MOST RECENT material_news trigger's headline is the marker" — while a non-material
            merge (crash/news_spike) can never clobber them, since its own payload simply carries
            no such keys (a plain ``{**old, **new}`` shallow merge leaves them untouched).
          * each material_news merge additionally APPENDS its own ``{at, cluster_tokens}`` onto
            ``payload["material_events"]`` — this is what `recent_material_events` reads so the
            INT12 subject-floor/fingerprint cooldown keeps counting each DISTINCT screen event
            correctly even though several of them may now live on the SAME coalesced row (see
