"""How an Automation's categorization is attributed in the audit trail.

Until 2026-08-02 a categorization rule was a DECLARATIVE row applied inside
``create_transaction``: the row was born with the rule's category, and the create event
carried an ``automation_applied`` block naming the rule, the category it replaced and why.
Thirteen tests pinned that (override of an explicit category, fill of a blank one, tag-only
matches not counting as a category decision, per-row stamping in bulk, splits and
adjustments never stamped, the edit path never emitting it, and a failure in provenance
never breaking the create).

Rules are now event-triggered Automations. Nothing is applied at create time — the row
commits, ``txn`` fires, and a Lucius run calls ``update_transactions``. So the create event
has no rule to name, and attribution moved to where the write actually happens: the audit
scope on the UPDATE, which the runner binds for every write a run makes.

These pin that surviving attribution. The create-time block is not re-tested because it can
no longer be produced — ``active_transaction_transforms()`` returns nothing and the store
refuses to create a transform.

``tests/test_automation_audit_provenance.py`` was deleted with the same change. Its six
tests covered the write-side half of the identical mechanism: usage counted only after the
transaction COMMITS (never on a preview), a bulk create preloading the automation set once
and recording each committed match, the LAST decider owning the provenance when several
matched, and a blocked category action counting as a match without claiming it. All six
describe a transform pipeline that no longer runs.
