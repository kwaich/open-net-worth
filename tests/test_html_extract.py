"""``ai/search/html_extract`` — the process boundary around trafilatura/lxml.

The claim under test is not "extraction works" but "a NATIVE crash in the parser cannot take
this process with it". That distinction is the whole reason the module exists: an
``except Exception`` around ``trafilatura.extract`` looks like it covers the failure and does
not, because ``abort()`` from libxml2 never becomes a Python exception. The demo died twice
on 2026-08-25 with that guard in place.

So the crash test really crashes: the child is replaced with a program that calls
``os.abort()``, producing a genuine SIGABRT in a genuine child process. If containment ever
regresses, this test file takes the whole pytest worker down with it — which is exactly the
failure it is here to prevent, made visible.
