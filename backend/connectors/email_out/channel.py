"""Email-out notification channel (generic, vendor-neutral push).

Registers an async ``_send`` on the ``core.channels`` seam so ``services.notify`` can
fan a message out by **email** WITHOUT ``services`` importing ``connectors`` — the same
inversion the Telegram channel uses (``connectors → core`` is a downward edge, so
import-linter Contract 1/4 stays green). The send uses stdlib ``smtplib`` + ``email``
(no new dependency).

Config lives on the Email connector (``EmailConfigStore.smtp_credentials()``, ``db/``): the
SMTP server plus the connector's ONE address as login, From and alert recipient, and its
single password. The channel is registered only when the connector is **enabled AND
configured**, so an unconfigured or paused instance simply has no email channel.

Error isolation: the blocking SMTP call runs in a thread and any failure is **caught**
and returned as ``{"error": ...}`` — a channel ``_send`` must never raise into the
Notifier (which also isolates per-channel, but we don't rely on that). Secrets are never
logged.
