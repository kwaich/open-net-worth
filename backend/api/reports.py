"""
Report library read API (P4-RP1).

A THIN router over ``services.reports`` — it validates the report-type + period enums and
shapes the response; every figure is composed in the service from the existing read services
(net worth, returns, realized P&L, income, spending), never here. Respects the dependency
rule: imports only the service (api -> services), no store / no math directly.

A report is computed-not-stored — a pure read, no write choke point.

Routes:
    GET /api/reports                       — the catalog (available report types)
    GET /api/reports/{type}?period=&format= — a generated report

``format`` (or the ``Accept`` header) selects the body: ``html`` (default — a self-contained
printable document) or ``json`` (the structured report model). When the HTML is served as a
downloadable file (``download=1``), it mirrors the export route's CSRF guard (Bearer token OR
``X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest``) — a report can carry the full financial picture, so a
top-level cross-site navigation that triggers a download must be blocked.

An unknown report type → 404; a bad period → coerced to the default by the service (defensive).
