"""Net-worth-history-derived Overview figures: range deltas, saved-vs-market attribution,
month-to-date change, and which composition series actually carry data.

The monthly series itself is already backend-computed (`ledger.net_worth_history()`). What
used to happen in the browser is the SLICING AND DIFFERENCING of that series — subtracting
two points to get "up S$1,000 over 3 months". A subtraction of two money values is still
money math, and it silently paired a client-side headline against backend history points
before the single-source fix. It lives here now.
