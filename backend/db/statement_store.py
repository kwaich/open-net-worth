"""
StatementStore — persistent storage for uploaded bank statement files and their parsed rows.

Each statement record keeps:
  - the original file bytes on disk (backend/data/files/statements/<id>.<ext>)
  - extracted text / page images (the upload cache entry, minus TTL)
  - parsed transaction rows once diff_statement has run
  - link to the import batch(es) created from this statement

Schema (as read/returned by every method below — see the PLAN 3 TASK 4 note for how
``parsed_rows`` is actually stored):
    id               : str   (UUID)
    created_at       : str   (ISO 8601 UTC)
    filename         : str   (original upload filename)
    mime             : str   (MIME type)
    size_bytes       : int
    file_hash        : str   (SHA-256 hex — used for dedup)
    file_path        : str   (relative path under DATA_DIR, e.g. "files/statements/abc123.pdf")
    kind             : str   ("text" | "pdf_pages" | "image")
    upload_entry     : dict  (full upload cache entry: text/images/media_type etc.)
    parsed_rows      : list | None   ({date, amount, direction, description} dicts)
    parsed_at        : str | None    (ISO 8601 when parsed_rows was last set)
    account_id       : str | None    (set when diff_statement associates it with an account)
    batch_ids : list[str]     (batch IDs created from this statement)
    source_attachment_id : str | None (the chat AttachmentStore id this statement was
                                        explicitly promoted from, when it was — cross-
                                        channel-attachments RFC item 22; never set by a raw
                                        upload/URL/paste import)

PLAN 3 TASK 4: DB-backed (Core, table ``statements_meta`` — backend/db/tables.py). Rows are
promoted-columns-over-verbatim-payload, EXCEPT ``parsed_rows``: the plan-3 task-3 absorb
extracts it to ``FILES_DIR/statements/<id>.parsed.json`` (``core.paths.statements_files_dir()``
— the ONE accessor every consumer calls, security review fix round 2 Fix 3; 2026-08-22
consolidate-derived-data-storage RFC retired the earlier, separate
``statements_parsed/`` directory) and keeps only the ``has_parsed_rows`` flag in the row —
every write here (``create``/``set_parsed_rows``/``add_batch_id``/…) continues that
extraction on EVERY write (not just at cutover), which is the whole point: a fat parsed-rows
list living inline in ``payload`` forever would just reintroduce the 21.6MB-file problem the
extraction solved, one row at a time. Every READ method
(``find_by_id``/``all``/``query``/``list_statements``/``find_by_hash``) therefore re-inlines
``parsed_rows`` from disk before returning — via ``money_io._reinline_statement``, shared with
``export_statements`` — so a caller sees EXACTLY the dict shape ``JsonStore``-backed
``StatementStore`` always returned; extraction is an internal storage detail no caller above
this store has ever had to know about. Every write that PATCHES (``update_by_id``/
``bulk_patch``) first reconstructs the full existing row (payload + reinlined ``parsed_rows``)
and merges ``changes`` on top of THAT — never the bare stored payload — so an unrelated patch
(e.g. ``add_batch_id``) that never mentions ``parsed_rows`` re-extracts the SAME bytes to the
SAME path (a redundant but harmless rewrite — not a loss of the path) instead of wiping it,
because the merge always sees the key already present. See ``money_io._statement_row``'s own
docstring for the full reasoning.

Hand-rolled, not a ``payload_store.PayloadTableStore`` subclass: every mutate here writes more
than the bare ``{seq, id, payload}`` shape ``PayloadTableStore`` writes, and reads need the
reinlining pass ``PayloadTableStore`` knows nothing about. The conn=/lock/hook plumbing mirrors
``PayloadTableStore``'s own (see that module's docstring for the CONN= COMPOSITION and
CHECKPOINTS contracts — honored identically here).

    """``DATA_DIR / file_path``, but only when it stays inside the statements directory.

    ``file_path`` has TWO writers and only one of them is trustworthy. ``create()`` builds it
    itself as ``files/statements/<server-minted-id><ext>``, so every statement the app stores
    is fine by construction. ``db.money_io._statement_row`` copies it VERBATIM out of an
    imported portable bundle, and ``validate_money_file_shape`` checks that bundle's row ``id``
    but never this field — so a hand-edited bundle can put any string here.

    That matters because of how the join behaves: ``Path("/data") / "/etc/passwd"`` is
    ``/etc/passwd`` — an absolute component silently DISCARDS everything to its left, no error
    raised — and ``../`` walks upward. Either escapes the directory the reader assumes it is
    confined to, which is why the old comment here ("file_path is stored relative to DATA_DIR")
    was an assumption rather than a guarantee.

    This mirrors ``AttachmentStore.blob_path`` and ``ReceiptStore.blob_path``, which already
    re-prove containment for exactly this reason, and the sibling ``_unlink_stored_file_path``
    in this file, which refuses to DELETE outside the directory. Reads simply never got the
    same treatment.

    The untrusted string is never JOINED onto a base. It is validated syntactically, and then
    the path is REBUILT from the trusted directory plus the row's own file name — so there is
    no join for a hostile value to win in the first place. (Validating and then joining would
    also have worked, but it keeps a sharp edge around for the next reader to grab; this shape
    has none.)

    Rebuilding also happens to be the only thing that behaves under the test harness, which
    redirects ``statements_files_dir()`` per-test while ``DATA_DIR`` stays at the pytest root.
    ``create()`` already documents that divergence and falls back to the production convention
    when it hits it; a ``DATA_DIR``-joined read cannot resolve that combination at all.

    Returns ``None`` (log + refuse) rather than raising: both call sites already treat "no
    readable file" as a normal outcome, so a refusal degrades to the missing-file path instead
    of surfacing an exception to the operator.
