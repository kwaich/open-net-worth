"""Print every registered AI tool with its parameters — the review artifact.

Why a script and not a doc: a hand-written tool list is the exact thing this codebase
keeps getting wrong. Descriptions drift from handlers, a rename leaves a dead name in a
stored playbook, a batch param keeps a singular name. A generated inventory cannot drift,
because it reads the live registry.

Usage
-----
    .venv/bin/python3 -m backend.scripts.tool_inventory              # human-readable
    .venv/bin/python3 -m backend.scripts.tool_inventory --json       # machine-readable
    .venv/bin/python3 -m backend.scripts.tool_inventory --lint       # ONLY the naming defects
    .venv/bin/python3 -m backend.scripts.tool_inventory --core       # just the CORE offer

The --lint pass encodes the rule the 2026-07-19 naming sweep applied:

    Is the array the set of ENTITIES the tool acts on, or an attribute OF one entity?

An entity set must be named plural, at BOTH the tool and the parameter. An attribute of a
single entity is correctly singular-named even though it is a list — `schedule_task` takes
`channels` because one task notifies many channels, and `update_grant` takes `tranches`
because one grant has many. Those are NOT defects and the linter must not flag them, which
is why ATTRIBUTE_LIST_PARAMS below is an explicit reviewed exemption rather than a
heuristic. A heuristic cannot tell the two apart; a person can, once.

The defect this catches, from a live failure the owner hit:

    delete_account(account_id='["acc_fbae2c470000", "acc_b1af41ae0000"]')
    -> {"ok": false, "error": "account not found — call list_accounts to get valid IDs"}

A singular parameter name that accepts a list invites the model to stringify it. Dispatch
now decodes that (registry.coerce_stringified_containers), but the name is the real fix.
