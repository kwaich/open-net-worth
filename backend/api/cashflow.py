GET /api/cashflow

Returns a month-by-month cash flow table = past actuals + forward projection. The
projection math lives in ``backend.services.cashflow`` (RFC P1-A5 §3.2/§3.3); this
router only parses the request, overlays committed obligations, and calls
``build_projection(...)``.

Also GET /api/cashflow/flow?month=YYYY-MM&compact= — one month's money-flow (Sankey) graph,
built by ``backend.services.cash_flow_graph``.

Query params (/api/cashflow):
  months               int   (1–60, default 40)  — forward projection length
  history_months       int   (0–24, default 6)   — past actual months to prepend
  income_override      float override the rolling-average monthly income
  expense_override      float override the rolling-average monthly expenses
  include_fixed_deposits bool add fixed-deposit balances to the runway (default false)
  include_investments    bool add investment positions + settlement cash to the runway
                          (default false)
