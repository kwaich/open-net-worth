"""One process-wide SQLAlchemy engine + the unit-of-work seam.

SQLite is the shipped default (WAL, foreign keys ON); Postgres is selected by
setting ONW_DATABASE_URL (e.g. postgresql+psycopg://user:pw@host/db). Repositories
accept an optional Connection so callers can compose several writes into ONE
transaction via unit_of_work() — the multi-store-atomicity seam the JSON stores
never had. locked_unit_of_work() extends this to SEVERAL stores' tables at once,
adding the per-table lock ordering that makes composing them deadlock-free (Plan 3
task 1 — the money-core choke-point seam). Spec:
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-storage-engine-sqlite-postgres-design.md.

# into e.g. ledger.create_transaction) runs INSIDE the outer unit_of_work()'s still-open
# transaction. A side effect that itself needs to open a SECOND write transaction (e.g.
# publishing a DB-backed automation event, storage plan 4c) must not fire from in there —
# SQLite allows only one open writer at a time, so a second begin() on the same engine
# blocks behind the first until PRAGMA busy_timeout trips, raising "database is locked"
# (empirically reproduced: tests/services/test_trade_choke_atomicity.py::
# test_vest_apply_does_not_self_deadlock_on_lot_mint). on_commit() lets such a side effect
# register itself instead of running immediately; unit_of_work() fires every registered
# callback exactly once, synchronously, right after ITS OWN transaction actually commits —
# and not at all if it rolls back, closing the sibling phantom-event-on-rollback gap for
# the same composed path (a rollback must publish nothing).
#
# Never nested in practice: a conn=-composed callee reuses the caller's connection instead
# of opening its own unit_of_work(), so exactly one of these is ever active per thread at a
# time (mirrors the non-reentrant per-table locks locked_unit_of_work relies on below) —
