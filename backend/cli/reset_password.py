"""`onw reset-password` — set a new password from the machine the book lives on.

The way back in when the old password is forgotten and the desktop app is not the front door:
only someone who can run a command here, as the user that owns the data folder, gets it. It
writes through ``AuthStore`` into the same database the server reads (the working folder is
resolved exactly as ``onw start`` resolves it), so it works whether or not the server is
running — the running server sees the new hash on its next request, and the rotated session
key signs every browser out.
