"""DATA SAFETY preamble — import this BEFORE any ``backend.*`` module.

``backend/core/paths.py`` resolves ``DATA_DIR``/``CACHE_DIR``/``LOGS_DIR`` from the
environment exactly ONCE, at import time. So the only way to guarantee an eval run
cannot touch the operator's live ``~/.open-net-worth`` tree is to set all three
BEFORE the first backend import — the same trick ``tests/conftest.py`` and
``backend/scripts/dedup_eval.py`` use.

We additionally set ``ONW_QA_MODE=1``, which makes ``core.config.assert_qa_data_dir_safe``
(called from ``core/paths.py`` at import) hard-abort the process if any of the three
resolves into the live instance tree. That turns "we remembered to isolate" from a
convention into a structural guarantee, per the CLAUDE.md QA rules.

This module is import-order-sensitive by design. Every other module in this package
imports it first.
