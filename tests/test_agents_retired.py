"""Agents are retired (2026-08-02) — the product, not just its tab.

The live-data audit that justified this: no Automation invoked an Agent, the scheduler ran
only Automations, and each Agent's prompt had already been inlined into an Automation's
instructions. These tests pin that the substrate is gone AND that the two generic mechanisms
sitting next to it survived, because both have live non-agent consumers.
