"""Report what is already in a data folder.

Choosing where the book lives is the one first-run decision that can quietly collide with an
instance that already exists — a second install pointed at a folder that already holds a book
is either exactly what the user wants (adopt my existing data) or the last thing they want
(two apps, one folder). The app cannot tell those apart, so it must SAY what is there and let
the person choose, rather than silently adopting or silently refusing.

Deliberately read-only and metadata-only: row counts and a timestamp, never contents, never a
directory listing. It answers "is something here, and how much" — nothing that would turn an
auth-gated endpoint into a filesystem browser.
