"""A connector conversation is named ONCE, from its channel and start time.

A web chat is topic-scoped — you open a new one per subject, so naming it after its first
message is exactly right, and that is what the frontend does
(``useConversations.updateConversationMeta`` → ``conversationTitleFromFirstMessage``).

A Telegram conversation is not that. It is ONE continuous thread per chat, running for
weeks, and its first message is usually a greeting: a real user conversation opened
with ``Hello``. Naming a month-long thread "Hello" says nothing. Worse, nothing was naming
it at all — the backend never set a title on the connector path, and the frontend, which is
the only thing that generates titles, filters connector conversations out of its list
(``ChatPanel``/``ConversationBrowser`` drop any row carrying ``channel``). So every Telegram
conversation stayed "New conversation" forever (owner, 2026-08-22).

**The chat id is deliberately NOT in the title.** The ``chat_id → session_id`` map lives in
the connector's ``sessions`` secret in ``connector_secrets`` (``session_map``), a
``core.sensitive.SECRET_TABLES`` member, and ``services.backup.write_sanitised_copy`` DELETEs
those rows from the ``onw.db`` inside a downloaded DR archive — specifically so a leaked backup
cannot be used to resume the owner's chat session. Sessions themselves ARE portable
(``services.portability.session_bundle_entries``). Putting the chat id in a session title
would therefore carry it into the very archive that strips the mapping, quietly defeating
an existing control. The START TIME does the disambiguating work anyway: ``/new`` mints a
fresh session for the same chat, so start time is what separates one thread from the next.

Set once, at first sight of the session, and never rewritten — a stable name is the point.
The frontend cannot clobber it either: it only renames a conversation still called exactly
``"New conversation"``.

Deliberately SEPARATE from ``session_map.py``, which must stay AI-FREE
(``services.connectors`` imports it directly, and ``services`` must never reach
``backend.ai`` even transitively — import-linter's layers contract). This module needs
``ai.assistant`` to read and write session meta, exactly like its sibling
``session_reset.py``. Nothing under ``backend.services`` may import either.
