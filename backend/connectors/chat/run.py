"""The ONE inbound→turn→reply path for every chat channel.

``handle_inbound(adapter, inbound)`` is the whole reuse story: allowlist → idempotency →
session lookup → ``processor.process_message`` (which runs ``assistant.run`` and dispatches
text + proposed-change cards back through the adapter's send methods). Telegram, Slack,
Discord (and every future channel) funnel through here — only the transport
(parse/verify/send) differs per adapter.

**Trust model — THE ALLOWLIST IS THE CONTROL.**

* The per-sender ALLOWLIST (default-deny, checked FIRST) decides WHO may talk to Lucius.
  Nobody reaches a turn without being on it, per connector.
* The adapter's ``trust_level`` no longer decides what a turn may DO. It still drives the
  shared-workspace hardening that has nothing to do with tool power:
  - ``untrusted`` (a shared Slack/Discord workspace, the DEFAULT) → the session is keyed
    PER-SENDER (``channel_id:sender_id``) so members never see each other's financial
    answers, plus a per-sender rate limit.
  - ``operator`` (a private Telegram bot, or an Operator-trust opt-in) → channel-keyed
    session, no per-sender rate limit.

**What changed, deliberately (owner-authorised):** an untrusted turn used to be narrowed to
a read+notify+propose ceiling, so a write off shared-channel text was structurally
impossible — the only path was a ``propose_*`` card the user tapped. That ceiling is gone.
An ALLOWLISTED sender in a shared Slack/Discord channel now gets the same tool offer as the
web app and can make Lucius write directly: log a transaction, edit or delete one, move
budget money, change the profile. The allowlist is what stands between a workspace member
and the ledger, so treat adding someone to it as granting them the app.

Unchanged and still load-bearing: a ``propose_*`` card is still bound to its proposer, so
only the sender who caused it may tap Confirm (the IDOR guard in ``chat/confirm.py``), and
the per-tap rate limit still applies.
