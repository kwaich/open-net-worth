"""AlertStore — standalone, ticker-keyed price alerts (ADR 0014).

A flat list, one row per condition, independent of watchlist membership. Each row:

    {id, ticker, instrument_id?, op, value, note, label, name, kind, channels, asset_class,
     on_trigger, cooldown_minutes, enabled, last_fired_at, created_at}

Decoupled from watchlist items so removing a ticker from a watchlist never destroys
its alerts, and setting an alert never forces the ticker into the "My holdings" list.
Rising-edge ("armed") state is NOT stored here — it stays runtime-only in the
monitoring price cache keyed by ``alert_cache_key()`` (ticker, "{op}{value}" for a price
alert, "{op}{value}%" for a move alert), so a checkpoint restore of the ``alerts`` table can
never silently re-arm or silence an alert. ``value`` is coerced to float on every write so
that cache key string stays stable across the migration.

``name`` is the alert's OWN short display name (e.g. "Stop-loss zone"), distinct from
``label`` (the ticker's display name). ``kind`` selects what ``value`` means: ``"price"``
(unchanged — a price level) or ``"move"`` (a percent threshold on the one-day move vs. the
previous close). ``channels`` is the alert's OWN external fan-out (channel ids, e.g.
``["telegram", "email"]``; ``[]`` = in-app only) — saved on the alert, never derived from any
other setting (ADR 2026-09-30-notification-channels-per-kind-and-per-alert). Which ids EXIST
is a services concern (``services.notify_routes.normalize_channels``); this store only keeps
the list well-formed.

PLAN 4D TASK 2: DB-backed (Tier-1, book-scoped, table ``alerts``) via
``BookPayloadTableStore`` — spec:139-140 lists alerts explicitly as Tier-1.
