"""Security-gate fix wave (plan 3 task 9) — at-rest posture + error hygiene on the engine.

FR-I3: the sqlite database file (and its -wal/-shm sidecars) are chmod'd 0o600 on connect —
financial data must not sit world-readable at 0644, matching auth.json's posture.
FR-M5: create_engine(hide_parameters=True) keeps bound SQL VALUES out of every DBAPIError
str() — that string reaches both the LLM context (ai/assistant.py) and the boot log
(migrate.py); a leaked "[parameters: (...)]" tail would carry row data into both.

Isolated tmp database throughout — the live tree is never touched.
