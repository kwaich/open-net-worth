"""watch_rules — deterministic signal rules for WATCHED (not held) tickers. Pure: no I/O, no clock
(``now`` is passed in), no LLM. Callers: ``watch_signals`` (emits feed stories) and ``watch_pulse``
(the Intel tab's watchlist read model).

With history (``watch_stats.history_stats``) a move is scored against the stock's own usual daily
move and split into company vs market vs sector; multi-day patterns (drawdown, streak, month vs
benchmark, a recent 200-day cross) come from the same history. Without it the fixed % thresholds
below are the floor. ``watch_intent`` adds the rules from why YOU watch the name; and
``material_triggers`` picks the few findings worth an explained (and pushed) alert.

A held name already gets crash-watch, risk signals and the portfolio brief; a watched name gets
nothing unless the user hand-set an alert. These rules give the watchlist the same "tell me when
something happened" coverage using only fields the batched Yahoo quote already returns (see
``prices.fetch_quote_snapshots``) — no per-ticker network calls, no extra search spend.

Each finding is ``{kind, tone, weight, severity, text}``. ``weight`` ranks attention in the pulse;
``STORY_KINDS`` is the subset material enough to raise a feed story (the rest stay pulse-only so a
permanently beaten-down stock doesn't pin a card to the feed forever).
