// Every monetary field on a row (base value, cost basis, unrealized P&L, day P&L, portfolio
// weight, the display-currency per-unit price/cost, "since grant" P&L) is computed by

// quote_per_unit, FX-converted per leg, cost basis, P&L, day P&L, and a weight for every row —
// running in the browser beside the backend's own fold. Two implementations of one thing
// drift, and this pair did: a S$120,000 net-worth headline against a true S$98,000, plus
// allocation bands that summed past 100%. See

// The `_`-prefixed field names are kept deliberately. They are read in ~40 components; renaming
// them would be a mechanical churn with no correctness benefit, and the rename below is the one
// place the mapping is stated.
