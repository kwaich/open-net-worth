"""Turn the subjects a trigger names — an account, a payee, a ticker — into the ids it stores.

subject the way a person would ("Grab", "Everyday Checking"). Either resolves here at the save
choke, by id or exact label; an unknown or ambiguous name is REFUSED rather than stored to
never match. A free-form price ticker is the one subject kept as typed (upper-cased).
