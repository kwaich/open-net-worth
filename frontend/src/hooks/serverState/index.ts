// Shared server-state hooks — one cache key AND one module-level fetcher per shared read.
//
// RFC: .claude/rfcs/2026-07-27-frontend-server-state-consolidation.md
//
// Why this layer exists: before it, 153 files called `authFetch` directly and every component
// that wanted accounts/profile/categories fetched them itself. A single page load issued the
// same GET 2-6x concurrently (measured 2026-07-27), which on a single-process GIL-bound
// backend cost N round trips of real CPU — /api/accounts profiled at 0.057s but was observed
// at 7.0s live, purely from queueing behind duplicates.
//
// Import from here, not from the individual files.
