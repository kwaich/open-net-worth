"""watch_stats — what a ticker's own recent history says about today's move. Pure: no I/O, no clock.

The quote snapshot alone can only say "down 9% today". Measured against the stock's OWN recent
behaviour it can say how unusual that is (a 3× usual-move day for a calm utility vs an ordinary
day for a volatile small cap), whether the move is the company or just the market / its sector,
and what the last few weeks look like (a losing streak, a drawdown from a recent peak, a recent
200-day-average cross, the month vs the benchmark).

Inputs are dated daily closes (``[(iso_date, close), …]``, any order) for the stock and the
benchmark, excluding today — today's move comes from the live quote. Too little history → None
(the rules then fall back to fixed % thresholds; nothing is ever estimated from thin data).
