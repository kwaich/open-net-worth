"""Security-gate fix wave (plan 3 task 9) — money-bundle import hardening.

FR-C1 (CRITICAL): an untrusted ``statements.json`` row's ``id`` is verbatim bundle JSON that
becomes a filesystem path component (``FILES_DIR/statements/<id>.parsed.json`` — 2026-08-22
consolidate-derived-data-storage RFC; this used to be ``DATA_DIR/statements_parsed/<id>.json``).
The review proved end-to-end that a bundle whose id was ``"../auth"`` rewrote ``auth.json``
(inbound-MCP Bearer takeover) and an absolute id escaped ``DATA_DIR`` entirely. The write must
be REFUSED, with ``auth.json`` byte- AND mode-preserved, and a malicious bundle rejected at
inspect time.

FR-M7 (Minor): an untrusted bundle amount ``"1e400"`` -> ``inf`` / ``"NaN"`` -> ``NaN`` / a raw
non-numeric string must be rejected on import, never survive verbatim into ``payload``.

Every test runs in an ISOLATED tmp DATA_DIR / STATEMENTS_FILES_DIR (monkeypatched) plus an
isolated tmp database (``db_isolated``) — the live ``~/.open-net-worth`` tree is never touched.

    every consumer now reads through ``core.paths.statements_files_dir()`` — security review
    fix round 2, Fix 3) and seed TWO canaries, mode 0600:

      - ``data_dir/auth.json`` — a real, sensitive file the exploit must never touch
        regardless of exactly where an escaped path would land (the id gate
        (``STATEMENT_ID_RE.fullmatch``) refuses ``"../auth"`` before ANY path is built, so
        this is a belt-and-suspenders proof, not a test of the escaped path's literal
        resolution).
      - ``data_dir/files/auth.parsed.json`` — fix round 2, Fix 4: the id gate's actual
        current escape target. ``parsed_dir`` is ``data_dir/files/statements`` in THIS
        layout, so ``id="../auth"`` resolves to ``parsed_dir/../auth.parsed.json`` ==
        ``data_dir/files/auth.parsed.json`` — NOT ``data_dir/auth.json``. Before this fixture
        seeded this second canary, the test's byte/mode-preservation assertions on
        ``data_dir/auth.json`` passed UNCONDITIONALLY regardless of whether the id-gate
        (layer 1) even ran, because an escape landing at the REAL current target would never
        touch the OLD canary's path either way — the assertions could not tell "the escape
        was refused" apart from "the escape succeeded, just not at the path we happened to
        be watching". Asserting this second canary is never CREATED closes that gap: it is
        the one file an actual (hypothetical, layer-1-bypassing) escape would write to.
