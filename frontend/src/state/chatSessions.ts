// chatSessions.ts — per-conversation chat state, a vanilla external store, NOT React state.
//
// RFC .claude/rfcs/concurrent-conversations.md (Phase 1) · ADR
// docs/adr/2026-08-06-a-turn-belongs-to-its-conversation-not-to-the-view.md
//
// A turn belongs to the conversation that started it, never to whichever conversation is
// on screen. Before this, the single useChat() instance held ONE messages array
// parameterized by the VIEWED conversation id, so a turn's SSE reducer wrote into whatever
// the user had switched to — conversation A's tokens landing on conversation B's bubble.
// Every conversation now owns its OWN slice, keyed by conversation id; the view is a
// SELECTOR over a slice, never its owner.
//
// Why an external store and not `useState<Map<id, ConvSlice>>`: a new Map identity on
// every token re-renders every context consumer — dock, panel, mobile shell, every
// message bubble — for a single delta in ONE conversation. `subscribe(id, cb)` notifies
// ONLY the subscribers of the slice that actually changed; `subscribeAll` is a second,
// coarser channel for STATUS transitions only (streaming started/ended), so a token
// landing in a background conversation never wakes a component that only cares "who is
// working right now" (the sidebar's live dots).
