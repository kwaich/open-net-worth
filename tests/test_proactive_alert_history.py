"""A proactive alert is an ORDINARY message, appended when it is sent.

Owner-driven rewrite, 2026-08-24. Everything this file used to pin — coalescing by
``subject_key``, an admission budget, a synthetic "[Automated monitor]" trigger turn, a
per-event character cap, injection at the next turn's start — is GONE, and the defects that
machinery caused went with it:

  * the count cap sliced in arrival order and discarded the NEWEST alerts, so the owner's
    "Mail scan" alert never reached the model and Lucius said it could not find it;
  * the 600-char record cap cut 12 of 15 live alerts mid-URL;
  * injection stamped every alert with the moment the user next replied, not when it was
    sent;
  * the synthetic trigger turn NAMED a conversation ("[Automated monitor — the following
    message was delivered to").

All of it existed to dodge one storage fact: ``sessions.transcript`` was a single JSON
column a running turn rewrote wholesale, so an alert arriving mid-turn would be clobbered.
It could not be appended, so it was summarised. Since the transcript became
``session_messages`` (revisions 0051-0056) an append is a plain INSERT with a
database-assigned key, and ``record_proactive_message`` takes the same session lock a turn
already holds.
