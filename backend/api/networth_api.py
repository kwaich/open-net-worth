GET /api/net-worth/history?period=1M|3M|YTD|1Y|ALL

The net-worth-over-time series for the Overview line chart. Thin over
`ledger_service.net_worth_history()` (the canonical computed-not-stored, base-correct
monthly reconstruction) with a period window applied: the full series is filtered to the
points on/after the period's start date (ALL = the whole series, unfiltered).

Distinct from the existing `/api/networth/history` (the all-time stacked-band chart on
Overview) — this one is the period-selectable single-line view. Both read the SAME
service projection, so they never drift; this route only adds the window selector.

Empty / young book → `{ history: [], base_currency, period }` (never 500): the service
returns `[]` when there is nothing to reconstruct, and an unknown period falls back to 1Y.

Response: { history: [{date, classes, liabilities, accounts, net_worth, market_tracked}],
            base_currency: str, period: str }
