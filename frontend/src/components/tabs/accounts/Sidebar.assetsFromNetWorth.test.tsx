// Regression: the sidebar's "Net worth" header showed Assets/Debts summed from the account
// GROUPS (cash + investments + retirement + property), which silently excludes owned assets
// (Assets tab) — an owned asset isn't an account and belongs to no group. On a book with an
// owned asset, Assets − Debts stopped equaling the Net worth figure shown directly above them
// by exactly the owned-assets total. Fix: `assets` is now DEFINED as `netWorth + debts` (the
// same rearrangement, in reverse, as the Assets-tab summary strip: own − owe = net worth), so
// the three numbers can never disagree.
