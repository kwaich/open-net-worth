"""Builds the submit/collect hooks registered on ``core.llm_seam`` — the ONE place
that decides which batch adapter runs, by ACTUAL endpoint capability
(``routing.resolve_adapter_key``), not the transport label alone. See
``routing.py``'s docstring for the incident that motivated this (a xAI batch submit
unconditionally routed to the OpenAI-native adapter and failed every call).

Handles are prefixed with their adapter key at submit time (``"xai:<real_id>"``)
so a COLLECT call for a batch minted before a config change still routes to the
adapter that actually holds it — a mid-flight batch submitted under xAI must not
be handed to whatever adapter the CURRENT config happens to resolve to after the
owner switches providers again.
