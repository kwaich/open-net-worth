"""Reports-group Overview figures: multi-month income/expense rollups, the category table,
top merchants and the savings rate. The month-flow Sankey lives in `cash_flow_graph`.

Planning's per-month view already aggregates each category. What the browser was doing on top
of it was a full second reporting layer — six months fetched in parallel, folded into totals,
ranked into a top-N with an "Other" remainder, averaged, and divided into a savings rate. All
of it moves here, so every widget in the group reads the same month totals instead of each
re-folding them from its own fetch.
