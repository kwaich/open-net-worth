/**
 * The config view's ONE primary action, published by whichever credential form is on screen.
 *
 * ## The defect this removes
 *
 * Every `*Section.tsx` form was written for the OLD Connectors tab, where it sat inline on a
 * card and owned its own Save button. The redesign re-hosted them as a view of the detail
 * modal — which supplies its own pinned footer — and both controls survived. The result was a
 * body `Save` and a footer `Done` on the same screen, with nothing telling the user whether
 * `Done` wrote their edits or dropped them. (It dropped them: `Done` was `leaveConfig`.)
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * The footer owns the action; the form owns the work. A form publishes `{ dirty, saving,
 * error, save }` through this context, the footer renders one `Save` button from it. Save just
 * saves (2026-08-22 — used to also navigate back to the detail page on success; that auto-close
 * was itself a bug for Telegram's pairing flow, bouncing the operator off the one screen that
 * shows live pending requests right when Save turned pairing on). Leaving — saved or not — is
 * the `‹ <name>` back control that was always there.
 *
 * `dirty` is real, not a placeholder: each form hands `useConnectorSave` its editable values
 * and the values the server last returned, and the button is disabled while they match. A
 * form that publishes nothing (an MCP server, an `.env`-managed connector — neither has a
 * form at all) leaves the footer with the plain Done it had before.
 *
 * ## Publishing every render is deliberate
 *
 * `publish` bails when the scalar state is unchanged, so calling it from an unconditional
 * effect cannot loop: the parent's `setState` is skipped, no re-render follows. The `save`
 * callback is kept in a ref rather than in state for the same reason — a form that rebuilds
 * its closure each render (all of them do) would otherwise re-render the modal forever.
