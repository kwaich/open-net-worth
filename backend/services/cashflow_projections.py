"""Forward-looking Overview figures: the passive-income crossover and the cash runway.

Both widgets were handed already-server-computed SCALARS (annual passive income, average
monthly expenses, liquid balance) and then did their own arithmetic on them: dividing the
annual figure by 12, taking a percentage of expenses, and projecting a month-by-month cash
depletion curve. Those are money operations, so they belong here — the widget plots the
points it is given.
